## Cloud Projects ☁️

A collection of hands‑on cloud engineering projects built using AWS services. This repository demonstrates serverless design, API development, and generative AI.

## Repository Structure 📁

| Project | Description | 
|--------|-------------| 
| **Cloud-Fun-Facts-Generator-GenAI** | A generative AI–powered fun facts generator using AWS services. | 
| **Serverless-Web-Application-On-AWS** | A fully serverless web application using Lambda, CloudFront, DynamoDB, and S3. |

## Projects Overview 🚀 

### 1. Cloud Fun Facts Generator (GenAI) 

A lightweight, serverless, interactive application that leverages Generative AI to produce fun, creative cloud computing facts on demand.

1. **Key Features:** AI-driven content generation, real-time responses, and cloud-native hosting.
2. **Core Stack:** Amazon Bedrock (GenAI), AWS Lambda, Dynamo DB, API Gateway and Amplify.
3. **Use Case:** Demonstrates the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into cloud infrastructure for creative automated content.

### 2. Serverless Web Application on AWS

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a fully serverless, cloud‑native web application using AWS managed services.

1. **Key Features:** User authentication, dynamic data processing, and automated scaling.
2. **Core Stack:** AWS Lambda, Amazon CloudFront, DynamoDB and Amazon S3.
3. **Use Case:** Ideal for modern applications requiring rapid deployment and low operational overhead.
